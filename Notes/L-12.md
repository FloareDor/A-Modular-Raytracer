# Geometry / Meshes

### Data Structures
- Space Efficiency
- Speed Efficiency

### Validity of triangle meshes
#### Impossible cases (pathological cases)
- Topological Validity
	- Surfaces should be manifold
		- Manifold surface is a nice surface
		- If we step on any point on surface, I have a neighbourhood that looks flat
		- If we make a small enough neighbourhood around our point, that should look flat
		- Every point should have a neighbourhood that looks flat
		- We want meshes with no unusual edges
		- No edge that lives on a plane b/w two triangles

	- Allow Boundary Edges
		- To weaken rules
		
	- Consistent Orientation
		- Mobius Strip
			- we cannot know which way is inside and which way is outside

- Geometrical Validity
	- Non-self-intersecting surface.
	- Can be difficult to guarantee.

### Data Structures to represent triangle meshes


#### Seperate Triangles DS
- Triangle1 - x0,y0,z0 - x1,y1,z1 - x2,y2,z2
- Triangle2 - x0,y0,z0 - x3,y3,z3 - x2,y2,z2

* But on average, every vertex is shared among 6 triangles

##### Average analysis of space using this data structure??

n - number of vertices (million)
4 bytes for each single precision float
so, 36 bytes for each triangle

a vertex is stored 6 times (used by 6 triangle)
each triangle has 3 vertices

6/3 = 2 triangles for 1 vertex

Cost = 2 * number of vertices

number of triangles = 2 million triangles
space taken = 2 million * 36 bytes

each vertex - > 2 * 36 = 72 bytes

- Cracks due to roundoff
- Difficult to find neighbouring triangles
- Therefore, it's slow to traverse
- BUT ALLOWS US TO UTILILZE CACHE EFFECTIVELY

##### Indexed Triangle Set DS

Store each vertex once
Store each triangle using indexes of vertex

We're seperating topology from geometry
Triangle stores topology
Vertex stored geometry

12 bytes per vertex

triangles = 2 * vertices
3 indexes for each triangle

2 triangles per vertex

24 bytes for geometry

=> 36 bytes per vertex



Pros/Cons
- Better space
- Impossible to store the triangles in a way that its contigous
- Not as cache efficient as Seperate triangles


We're not dealing with a soup of triangles
but they're nicely connected to each other filling space nicely

So....

##### Triangle Strips DS

Triangular meshes usually represent surface not a soup of triangles

- Each triangle is usually adjacent to previous one
- Let every vertex create a triangle by REUSING 2nd amd 3rd vertices of the previous triangle
- Every sequence of 3 vertices is a triangle
- Encoding mechanism basically

Decoding Algorithm
- take every 3 consequent numbers and decode a triangle
- (0,1,2,3,4,5) -> (0,1,2), (1,2,3), ...

- Strip[0] - 4,0,1,2,5,8
- Strip[1] - 6,9,0,3,2,10,7

The space needed depends on our stripification algorithm.

We need more continous strips
- * NP Complete Problem
	- Quick way of checking if solution works
	- But no way of quickly solving
	- So, exponentially many times, we gotta solve and check the problem

* Value of theory is knowing the boundaries of computation
* Incredibly important to know this

Assuming we have long enough strips

array of vertex positions -> 12 bytes per vertex
array of index lists -> 2 + n indices per strip
on avg 1 index per triangle -> 4 bytes
.
.
.
20 bytes per vertex


##### Winged-Edge DS
- Great for traversing
- Face -> Edge -> Face
- Bad space
- Mega speed
