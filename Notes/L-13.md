## Mesh Processing Applications

#### Data on meshes
- most important data per vertex is the vertex geometry -> (x,y,z)
- but, in most practical applications we need more information
	- for example
		- the color at that vertex
		- normal (nx,ny,nz)
		- Texture coordinates

#### Texture Mapping
- Map 2D image on 3D object
- The texture mapping is done using texture coordinates
	- They tell us how to and where to paste the 2D image on the 3D object

So, the vertex array:

Vertex 0: [x,y,z, nx,ny,nz, R,G,B] -> these letters are called attributes -> they are properties of vertices
Vertex 1: [x,y,z, nx,ny....]

but what is the normal vector?
of a not so simple shape?

Should I really bother storing normal information? Can I not just calculate it on the go?

Usually its the average of all the triangles surrounding the point?

Sure that'll work, but what if we break it a little bit

# Normal vector is telling us where the surface is facing!
This is also related to calculus

Tangent plane that touches the surface at our point
The normal is orthogonal to that tangent plane
 - Multivariable calculus

 It's essentially hard to calculate

So, we extract the normal information from the source and associate each vertex with normal information

If we wanna store a sphere with a mesh

-> We can store using 10 triangles, 100 triangles, 100 Million triangles...

As the number of triangles increases, the error increases -> O(h^2)

But the surface normal error is linearly increasing -> O(h)

The max surface position error drops by a factor of n^2
But the max surface normal error is dropped only by n

So, no matter how many triangles we use we'll only reduce the error by some amount

So, better store the real normal at each vertex

# Geometric Transformations
- We need to relearn linear algebra

Object space -> World Space -> Camera space -> Canonical view volume -> Screen Space
Modelling transformation -> camera transformation -> project transformation -> viewport transformation

## *Eigen Values and singular values are very important things in linear algebra

but Eigen values are nothing but world space to camera space transformation
- Matrices are black box systems that take points and give points
- Eigen values are nothing but changing coordinate systems


## Vectors

[x,y] -> 2D
[x,y,z] -> 3D

two operations needed to call a vector an object
- scaling
- adding
