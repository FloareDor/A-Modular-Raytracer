## Geometry

Note: Capital letters represent Vectors

### Two ways of representing geometry:
- #### Explicit Representation (Parametric)
	- Function that generates all of the points in our shape
	- e = curved e in discrete math (belongs to)
	- {f(t) | t e D}
	- Tracing
	- Line: {P + tD | t e R}
	- Circle: {P + r[cos(t), sin(t)] | t e [0, 2pi]}

- #### Implicit Representation
	- Its just a checking function!!
	- Object is a set of points v that satisfies the equation
	- {v | f(v) = 0}
	- We dont have a way of generating all the points in our shape,
	- , but it says that all the points in the line satisfy some check
	- Line : {V e R^2 | V.A = k}
	- It just says all of the points on the line satisfy the equation V.A = k
	- x1.x2 + y1.y2 = k => 3x - 5y = 2

	- Circle
		- {V e R^2 | (V-P).(V-P)=r^2}
		- (x-3)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 9
		- Does (2,2) belong to this shape?
		- (2-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 = 9
		- We can't trace an object directly, we only have a yes or no check

#### Examples:

{x,y e R^2 | max(|x|,|y|) = 1}
What shape does this equation represent?
- Square
- Draw an X, Y axis
- Plot the points using implicit representation
- This represents the peremeter of the shape

{x,y e R^2 | |x|+|y| = 1}
- Represents a diamond

{x,y,z e R^2 | max(|x|,|y|,|z|) = 1}
- Cube

{x,y,z e R^2 | |x|+|y|+|z| = 1}
- Octahedron
- Two Pyramids that are touching each other at the bottom

{x,y,z e R^2 | max(|x|+|y|,|x|+|z|, |y|+|z|) = 1}
- Volumetric Raycasting
- Shoot a ray to this object (P+tD)
- Now we wanna solve this ray-whatever this intersection problem
- Its hard tracing, but we can march towards this object

- t = 0.5, P+tD = [3,-1,5], the equation would be bigger than 1
- t > 0.5, P+tD = [x,y,z], the equation would get close to 1
- We wanna slow down near the boundary

- How to calculate the normal?
	- Shoot 5 rays around the center
	- Find the intersection along the 5 rays
	- You get a plane there

### Triangle Meshes

- Using building blocks to represent objects
- Polygons/Triangles or even Quad meshes
- Representing a shape that does not have a nice implicit or explicit formula
- If 3D -> Tetrahedron

- A small triangle mesh:
	- A list of triangles / a soup of triangles
	- 12 triangles, 8 vertices
- Large triangle mesh
	- 10 Million triangles (Mesh scanned by laser scanner)
	- SOO many triangles

Laser Scanner:

Scanner -----> Object intersection ([x,y,z])
The ray is echoed back from the intersection point (t _ delta(time))
Based on the time, we can tell the x,y,z coordinates of the object
This gives like one point
- Laser scanner scans the object in a rasterization manner, in ever instance it records the [x,y,z] coordindates of the object


How to convert those coordinates to triangles:
- There is no unique way of turning points into triangles
- There are geometric algorithms of taking point clouds, turning them into triangles (Devoney Triangulation Algorithm)
- * Devoney Triangulation Algorithm
	- I will only connect these 3 points to form a triangle, if I can fit a circle within them
	- Non - trivial algorithm to take Scan data to meshes.
- Stanford Uni
	- Taking a scanner and acquiring historical data

- Trillion triangles from automatically processed satellite and aerial
	- We shoot rays and record the time it takes to get the reflected ray back
	- Is there an area of research in using sound to create 3D vizualization as well?
	- The pipeline has to be able to handle these many images

#### What does it take to represent triangle mesh in our program using a data structure
- We want a data structure to represent a list of connected triangles
- Our DS goals:
	- Compactness (avoid waste spending of bytes)
	- Efficient access (traversal)

- To get there...

##### Topology vs Geometry:
- Two seperate issues
- Topology: how triangles are connected
- Geometry: the coordinates of the vertices I think?
- Topologies are people who can't tell the difference between donuts and coffee mugs

##### Validity of triangle meshes
- We do not wanna have certain kind of meshes that have these features
- Should be a Manifold
	- No points should be special
	- Shapes with small connection to a different entity shape
- Consistent  Orientation
	- Clear inside and a n outsite
	- Should not be non orientable (Mobius Strip)
